# Confidential Data Procedures

At the Koc School FRC Club, confidentiality of information is given the utmost priority. We understand that disclosure of information may cause unwanted effects for recipient parties of our communications.

To carry out our communications confidentially while still responding to all our our sponsors', teammates and member applicants we follow strict guidelines when we send and receive emails.

Incoming and outgoing emails are given a privacy rating as early as possible when it arrives at our systems that are maintained by Microsoft and our own team. All email accounts are protected with high password standards and 2FA is enforced on any account that has administrative access to our systems or is of high clearance in the team. On-premise information is stored on encrypted drives and is blocked of the hosting provider's access. Microsoft hosted services are encrypted by Microsoft and are only accessible through our team's own Active Directory accounts authenticated with industry standard Single Sign On standards such as OIDC and SAML.

In addition, all the team members are familiarized with the below levels of email confidentiality.

**P0: Public**  **→** Emails that can be openly disclosed without any permission. These emails are only emails that do not include any personal information other than the recipients name and email address. These may be certificates for participating an event or a birthday message*.

**P1: Private →** Emails that may be shared by the recipient party and the sending party inside their organization without the other's permission. 3rd party disclosure is subject to both parties' approval. Any message that includes personal information is at least this level such as a club roster or bus address list that is shared with the tour company.

**P2: No-disclosure →** Emails that are not meant to be disclosed without the other party's consent. You may add a party from your organization if you have verbally consented all the parties. Anyone added must be in the email thread. Sharing in private is not allowed. All sharing must be traceable. These emails should not be copied outside the protected inboxes. These include sponsorship discussions and similar.

**P3: Confidential →** These emails can not be shared except written permission from all parties. Must not be disclosed to anyone outside RAMs and the recipient party's organization.

The Koc School FRC Club reserves its right to disclose any conversation to legal authorities and the Koc School. Encryption keys are shared organization wide and administrative access will grant access to all inboxes. Administrative access is only granted to the team captain(s), club secretary-general (if different from the team captain) and club vice president(s). Assistants, division leaders and coordinators are not granted administrative access.

*Year of birth must not be revealed.

Please contact Team Captain/Club Secretary-General through the Administrative Assistant for questions.
